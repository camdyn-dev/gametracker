## can we do it

TODO:

add delete and edit routes to gamedetails, more specifically delete

make the edit route cool when u add it (like open a radio group upon clicking edit)

refactor the styles - so many styles are inline and re-used, I really need to fix them up after functionality is added !important

find a better way of doing the setTimeout things across creating, editing and deleting stuff (dynamicness thingy)

center notes on smaller screen sizes

fix titles and delete on smaller screen sizes

add filtering functionality on main page (show only completed, uncompleted or partial, anything else I decide to add yknow)

add both a scoring system and want to play scale (mostly for filtering honestly)
