# Game Tracker

## Hey!

Recently, I finished up a course on React, and wanted to try out the knowledge and skills I picked up by creating a real, useful project. I decided to go with a game tracker, as it'll be useful to me. I've recently gotten into retro gaming, so I have a pretty large backlog that I'd like to be able to track. I think this accomplishes that pretty well.

This is the front-end, written in React. There are quite a few advantages this provides over something like Google Keep or just a simple notepad file, for example;

- Filtering and ordering
- Priority, status and quality ratings for tracking
- Simple and more appealing UI
- Per-game note taking functionality

And more!

While most of the core functionality and nicer features are already implemented, there's definitely still work to be done (mainly refactoring), so I will continue to work on and improve this over time. Might refactor it into a broader, media tracking app (i.e., include TV and movies), or I might focus in on game-specific features.

If I'm honest, this project might've been easier to implement with vanilla JS and a templating engine like EJS.
