# Game Tracker
Recently, I finished up a course on React, and wanted to try out the knowledge and skills I picked up by creating a real, useful project. I decided to go with a game tracker, as it'll be useful to me. I've recently gotten into retro gaming, so I have a pretty large backlog that I'd like to be able to track. I think this accomplishes that pretty well.

This is the front-end, written in React. There are quite a few advantages this provides over something like Google Keep or just a simple notepad file, for example;

- Filtering and ordering
- Priority, status and quality ratings for tracking
- Simple and more appealing UI
- Per-game note taking functionality

And more!

As for things to note about this from a developer side;
- Front end written in React, using Material UI for a beautiful presentation
- Full-stack, CRUD operations for both game tracking and note taking that utilizes a backend on Node.Js with MySQL
- Priority, status and quality ratings for each game, which you can use to filter through game posts.
- Reactive UI that scales given your device's screen size.
