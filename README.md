## can we do it

TODO:

add delete functionality to game and notes - DONE

add edit functionality to game and notes - DONE
-maybe add an optional edit form for games? like, I should add the ability to toggle completion status and wantToPlay easily over title, but maybe adding an extra form to change the title, image and everything together wouldn't be a bad idea.

make the edit route cool when u add it (like open a radio group upon clicking edit)

refactor the styles - so many styles are inline and re-used, I really need to fix them up after functionality is added !important

find a better way of doing the setTimeout things across creating, editing and deleting stuff (dynamicness thingy)

center notes on smaller screen sizes

fix titles and delete on smaller screen sizes

add filtering functionality on main page (show only completed, uncompleted or partial, anything else I decide to add yknow)

add both a scoring system and want to play scale (mostly for filtering honestly)

add rating icons and maybe make the whole icon display it's own component IMPORTANT
